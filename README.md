📘 Personalized Learning Recommendation System
📌 Overview

Traditional education often follows a one-size-fits-all approach, ignoring that each learner has unique needs.
This project builds a Personalized Learning Recommendation System that leverages Machine Learning to recommend the right content to the right learner at the right time.

🎯 Goal → Enhance engagement, improve performance, and create adaptive learning paths for students.

🚀 Features

📊 Learner profiling based on past performance & preferences

🧠 ML-driven personalized course/content recommendations

🎯 Adaptive learning path generation

🔍 Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE

🌍 Scalable to e-learning platforms, MOOCs, universities

📂 Dataset

The dataset includes:

👨‍🎓 Student ID & demographics

📖 Courses enrolled

📈 Performance metrics

📝 Learning style preferences

⏳ Engagement history

(File: personalized_recs_dataset.csv)

⚙️ Methodology

Data Preprocessing – Clean, normalize, handle missing values

Feature Engineering – Extract learning styles & performance trends

Model Training – Apply ML/Recommender algorithms

Evaluation – Compare metrics with baseline methods

Recommendation – Generate adaptive learning paths
